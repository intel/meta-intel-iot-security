Subject: [PATCH 6/9] tizen-smack: Tuning user@.service.m4.in

- set SmackProcessLabel
- set DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
- set capabilities

Note: This patch should remain downstream, since it relies on the
Tizen-specific three-domain model.

On Tizen, all user@.service.m4.in instances should run with the User label, so
use the new SmackProcessLabel key to set it at runtime.

This was at first set by user-session@.service.m4.in, then by many services
(bt-fwrk) and scripts (weston.sh). This patch makes it again available
for whole user environment.

Include CAP_MAC_ADMIN and CAP_SETGID in inheritable capability set for the
whole user session. All programs started in the session will have this
enabled, unless they drop it explicitly or someone does that in proper
systemd services.

This change alone doesn't give any special capabilities to the processes.
It merely enables them to inherit capability while executing programs that
have those caps in inheritable and permitted sets (+ei).

The above change is meant as a part of solution for setting Smack label and
process groups for applications. Respective application launchers (for now
only Crosswalk) will get file capabilities mentioned above. In run-time
they will call a designated function for setting Smack label and groups and
drop the capabilities.

It seems that also CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE will be needed to bypass Smack checks
during modification of socket labels:

kernel: type=1400 audit(1416390778.371:3): lsm=SMACK fn=smack_inode_setxattr
action=denied subject="User" object="_" requested=w pid=2422
comm="amd_session_age" name="UNIX" dev="sockfs" ino=14108

CAP_MAC_ADMIN only allows policy administration, it doesn't override the
checks.
