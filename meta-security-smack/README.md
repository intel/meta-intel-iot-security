I. Adding the security-smack layer to your build
================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the security repository exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the security-smack layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-intel-iot-security/meta-security-smack \
    "

It has some dependencies on a suitable BSP; in particular the kernel
must have certain Smack-related patches. For linux-yocto 3.14, the
necessary patches are added by this layer. The necessary kernel
configuration parameters are added to all kernel versions by this
layer.

Just adding the layer does not enable Smack. These changes can be
enabled and disabled separately via configuration variables. To enable
Smack security, add the following entries to local.conf:

    # Enable Smack support. May also be done by a distro config,
    # (using DISTRO_OVERRIDES and directly updating DISTRO_FEATURES,
    # without the _append).
    OVERRIDES .= ":smack"
    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " smack"

    # Enable systemd.
    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " pam"
    DISTRO_FEATURES_append += " systemd"
    VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
    DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"
    VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
    # CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "systemd-analyze"

    # Need Smack support in file utilities.
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "coreutils"

    # Having Smack utilities is useful.
    CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "smack-userspace"

By default, enabling Smack as described above will also make Smack
the default LSM when compiling the kernel, overriding the choice
that may or may not have been made in the BSP kernel config.

If that is not desired, a distro conf can use:
    # Do not override default LSM configuration.
    SMACK_DEFAULT_SECURITY ?= ""

Using the weaker "?=" assignment allows a user to revert that
choice once more in a local.conf with:
    # Make Smack the default LSM.
    SMACK_DEFAULT_SECURITY = "${SMACK_DEFAULT_SECURITY_CFG}"

II. Misc
========

This layer intentionally limits itself to configuration changes of
existing components, plus the new Smack userspace library and
tools. See the other layer(s) in this repository for higher level
security components meant to work together with Smack.
